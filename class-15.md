## Component-Based Architecture

### What is a “component”?

Component is a "software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities"[^1].


### What are the characteristics of a component?

According to [Component-Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm), the characteristics of Components are:

- Reusability 
  - it is designed to be reused in different applications and in different situations; some components may also have a specific task
- Replaceable 
  - it can be replace or substituted with similar components
- Not Content specific
  - it can operate in different contexts and environments
- Extensible
  - to provide new behavior, it can be extended
- Encapsulated
  - it does not expose internal processes details and it depicts interfaces
- Independent
  - it has minimum dependencies on other components
