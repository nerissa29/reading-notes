## Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API

### Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

CRUD stands for *Create, Read, Update, and Delete*; It's a concept that describes the four basic functions "that models should be able to do and are considered necessary to implement a persistent storage application [^1]". The four basic function it represents are *create, read, update, and delete* which corresponds to *post, get, put, and delete* in HTTP/REST methods. CRUD is a function that can live within REST; REST is a standard API architecture.

### If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

- Bring in all the required libraries and routers required
- require the model
- 
- Export the router
