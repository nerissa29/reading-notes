## Creating Hyperlinks

- To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside the *brackets **[]***. This will convert the text to a link, and upon clicking, the web browser goes to another web page or URL[^1].

## The href attribute contains what information? 

- The *href attribute* (Hypertext Reference), contains the web address.

```
<a href="https://www.almanac.com/plant/roses">
```

## What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers? 

- Adding keywords to the link text to give a description as to what is being linked. Users find the descriptive text link useful.
- Good semantic - easier to develop than non-semantic HTML; it is better on mobile ue to it's lighter size, and good for SEO. The search engines usees keywords found in headings, or links than keywords found in <div>. The webpage will most likely be easier to find and accessible to the users[^2].

  
## CSS Layout 

## What is meant by “normal flow”?

Normal flow is the display of inline or block elements before making any changes to the layout[^3].
