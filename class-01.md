## Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

The browser loads the HTML and converts it into a Document Object Model or DOM. 
The browser will then fetch the resources linked to the HTML document; this could be embedded videos, images, or CSS. 
The browser parses and sorts the fetched CSS into different rules by their selector types, such as element, ID, class, and many more. 
It finds and works out the rules that need to be applied on nodes, .attaching the style to them
