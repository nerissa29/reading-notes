## Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

The browser loads the HTML and converts it into a Document Object Model or DOM. 
The browser will then fetch the resources linked to the HTML document; this could be embedded videos, images, or CSS. 
The browser parses and sorts the fetched CSS into different rules by their selector types, such as element, ID, class, and many more. 
It finds and works out the rules that need to be applied on nodes, .attaching the style to them


## How can you find images to add to a Website?

The <img></img> tag is used to embed an image into the web page; it links the images to the web page. The <img></img> tag creates as a placeholder for the referenced image. Two required attributes include:
-	Src – specifies the image’s path
-	Alt – an alternate text for the image



## What is the Difference between the <article></article> and <section></setion> element tags?

The ***<section></section>*** tag creates and defines a section in the HTML document, while the ***<article></article>*** tag creates and defines a self-contained content.


## What Elements does a “typical” website include?
The HTML provides tags one can use to denote a section. Examples would be:
-	Header - <header></header>
-	Navigation bar - <nav></nav>
-	Main content - <main></main>, which may also include subsections such as:
  - <article></article>
  - <section></section>
  - <div></div>
- sidebar - <aside></aside> which is also placed mostly inside the <main></main>
- footer - <footer></footer>
