## Reading Notes

### The Growth Mindset

Improving hard technical skills can provide you with new opportunities to expand your knowledge and do more things in the technical field (Happy Bear Software, n.d.). Upgrading your technical skills doesn't happen overnight; it requires much practice. The Happy Bear Software (n.d.) describes the "key ideas behind the deliberate practice" as:

- one that pushes you outside of your comfort zone
- it is repeated often
- mentally demanding
- difficult
- having a goal is necessary
- feedback "on results in continuously available"

The [The Matasano Crypto Challenges](https://web.archive.org/web/20160620111206/http://cryptopals.com/) and [Rosalind](https://web.archive.org/web/20160607102654/http://rosalind.info/about/) are both great examples of exercises designed to help and improve one's technical skills or specialty (Happy Bear Software, n.d.).

As Dweck () once mentioned, she describes the growth mindset as someone who understands that abilities can be developed. As for Duckworth (n.d.), she describes a growth mindset as "a great idea for building grit", an idea developed by Dweck that "the ability to learn is not fixed" and that "it can change with your effort" Duckworth (n.d.).

### Reflection on Bias

One of the strongest fields I have is ‘Courage’ and ‘Meaningful Connections’, as I am always open to hearing and listening to other people's opinions. I find standing up for oneself, and others are important. I am starting to learn more and more to let out my emotions, opinions, and advice while also trying my best not to offend someone - defending something or someone, making my opinions/feelings very clear. On the other hand, I am still working on getting out of my comfort zone and trying different things, not my usuals or use-to.

### Emotional Intelligence

Although I struggle to maintain a conversation, I can show empathy and express my feelings without upsetting others. I sometimes try to understand someone's situation by thinking about how I would feel and react when put in the same situation. I score well or fair on the others, but my social skills and awareness still need work.
