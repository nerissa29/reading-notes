## Classes and Objects

A class is a blueprint that decribes behaviors and properties; the object, an instance, has these properties/behaviors. According to Learnpython (n.d.), "Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity"; they get these functions and variables form classes.

An example provided in Learnpython (n.d.) is as follows:

```
"class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")"

```

To assign the above class into an object, it would look like this:

new_object = MyClass()

The *new_object* will now hold the class *MyClass'* objects, such as its variables and functions. To access the variable, it will be:

new_object.variable
