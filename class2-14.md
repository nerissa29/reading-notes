## Reading Notes 14

###  That Time When Women Stopped Coding

#### What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

It was around 1980's that something has changed. Professors assumed that their students grew up playing or are familiar with computers at home. When personal computers were introduced (games and such), people at that time believe that it's designed for boys and not for girls. Boys at that time has more advantage learning and playing with computers because of the idea that it wasn't meant for girls [^1]. When it comes to college, women who studied computer science or atleast tried to, were way behind compared to their male classmates.


#### Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

The idea became a narrative that playing computers only belong to males and not females. It became a problem when women entered college to study Computer Science, their knowledge is way behind and the Professors expected more or assumed that the level of their knowledge must have matched knowledge of their male students who grew up playing and familiar with computers. There were no equal opportunity.


### Why diversity matters to your tech company

#### When are diversity efforts most successful?

According to Joelle Emerson, in his article [When are diversity efforts most successful?](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/), diversity matters to tech for the following reasons:

- Diverse teams are smarter and more creative
- Diverse companies perform better
- Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base 

Without diversity, companies will be losing those with great talents.

#### Why do diverse companies perform better?

Diverse teams are proven to be "smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones [^2]". Failing to hire employees from different backgrounds, or being bias, have caused some companies to miss out on great talents.

#### Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

Diversity can attract users with same culture, same life experiences, and same demography. Tracy Chou once said:

   "*We only stand to improve the quality and impact of our products if the people building them are representative of the user base and reflect the same diversity of demography, culture, life experiences and interests that makes our community so vibrant[^2]*".
