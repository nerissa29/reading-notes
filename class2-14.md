## Reading Notes 14

### That Time When Women Stopped Coding

#### What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

It was around the 1980s that something changed. Professors assumed that their students grew up playing or were familiar with computers at home. When personal computers were introduced (games and such), people at that time believed that it was designed for boys and not for girls. Boys at that time had more advantage learning and playing with computers because they believed it wasn't meant for girls [^1]. When it comes to college, women who studied computer science, or at least tried to, were way behind compared to their male classmates.


#### Why does it matter that males have been playing on computers growing up?

The idea became a narrative that playing on computers only belongs to males, not females. It became a problem when women entered college to study Computer Science. Their knowledge was way behind, and the Professors expected more or assumed that their knowledge level must have matched the knowledge of their male students who grew up playing and were familiar with computers. There were no equal opportunities.


### Why diversity matters to your tech company

#### When are diversity efforts most successful?

According to Joelle Emerson, in his article [When are diversity efforts most successful?](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/), diversity matters to tech for the following reasons:

- Diverse teams are more innovative and more creative
- Diverse companies perform better
- Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base 

Without diversity, companies will be losing those with extraordinary talents.

#### Why do diverse companies perform better?

Diverse teams are proven to be "smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones [^2]". Failing to hire employees from different backgrounds, or being biased, have caused some companies to miss out on great talents.

#### Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

Diversity can attract users with the same culture, life experiences, and demography. Tracy Chou once said:

   "*We only stand to improve the quality and impact of our products if the people building them are representative of the user base and reflect the same diversity of demography, culture, life experiences and interests that makes our community so vibrant[^2]*".
