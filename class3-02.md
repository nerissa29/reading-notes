## Reading Notes 2: The Bash Command Line

### The Command Line

According to [Ryans Tutorials: The Command Line!](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php), a terminal/command line is a "text based interface to the system". It allows you to enter commands by typing, giving results as text. It starts with a prompt; since I'm using Ubuntu, the prompt as I open it looks like this:

**issa29@DESKTOP-N7B8RN9:~$**

Based on the image below, as stated in [Ryans Tutorials: The Command Line!](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php):

Line1 = the prompt **issa29@DESKTOP-N7B8RN9:~$**, followed by the command **ls**, and the command line **-l /home/issa29**; spaces separate these three. the command *ls* is used to list files, while *-l* is an *option* "used to modify the behavior of the command[^1]".

Lines 2-5 = the output or the results after executing the command.

Line 6 = back with the prompt again.

#### Opening a terminal[^1]:

For Mac Users:
Applications > Utilities > Terminal

For Linux:
Applications > Utilities > Terminal **or**
Applications > System > Terminal

For Windows Users:
(Mine is) Apps > Installed Apps > Terminal
[Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) is another way if user wants to "remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client[^1]‚Äù.

#### Shell, Bash

A **shell** is a part of OS that shows how the terminal behaves after running/executing the commands; **bash (Bourne again shell)** is one of the most common *shells* [^1]. Typing the **echo $SHELL** on the terminal displays the shell you are using, as shown in the image below:

<img width="563" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113204667/207968282-a9ec96e2-3fd7-4c42-97c3-1e10235ef04f.png">

#### Shortcuts

The commands entered are usually stored in history; one can use the arrow keys up and down to scroll the history instead of typing the same command again[^1].

### Basic Navigation[^2]

#### pwd

The **pwd** (Print Working Directory) lets you know the current working directory you are in.

<img width="608" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113204667/207969826-4ff08cc3-dbb3-450c-8b0d-b3ecca97f850.png">

#### ls

The **ls** (list) states or lists the files or directories on your current location.

<img width="526" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113204667/207970837-ca0c61df-3717-4a27-ad5c-02b5ff8a0f26.png">

#### ls -l

The **ls -l** includes long lists, and the *d* in *drwxr-xr-x* indicates that the file is a *directory*; if *-*, it is a normal file. The next 9 characters indicates the permissions for that file/directory. The next field indicates the number of blocks, the next one indicates the owner, and then "the group the file or directory belongs to[^2]". The *4096* is the file size, the next is the date and time it was modified/created, and then the filename/directory name.

<img width="529" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113204667/207971621-4fbee4ad-577b-485d-8829-d3add3af5632.png">

#### ls /etc

The command **ls /etc** lists the directories' contents (not including the directory name, but the contents).

#### ls -l /etc

The command **ls -l /etc** includes a long listing of the directories contents.

#### Paths: Absolute and Relative

The *path* lets you get to a specific directory or file[^2]. Two types of paths are **absolute** and **relative**. The **/** indicates the root directory.

An example of *relative path* is:

<img width="596" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113204667/207975120-1cf5a960-d8c2-4356-a040-b125736c719a.png">

An example of an absolute path is:

<img width="521" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113204667/207975564-83d10209-6bcd-40db-9d41-9cd9d42888ab.png">

#### Other building blocks on Paths[^2]

We can use the following to refer to a location:

- **~** and **cd (without arguments)** -> is a shortcut for home directory
- **.** -> is a "reference to your current directory[^2]"
- **..** -> is a "reference to the parent directory[^2]"
- **cd /h + Tab** -> invokes an auto-complete of the directory that starts with "h". Also, if Tab is hit once again, it will show the next possibilities

The **cd** stands for change directories.

<img width="567" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113204667/207980031-61388fef-db03-4664-aeed-c5f1d4d6604d.png">


### More About Files[^3]

With Linux, **everything is a file**, including text files, directory, keyboard - the system that reads from, and monitor - the system that writes to[^3]. A file extension is usually made up of 2-4 characters. This extension states the type of file, such as:

- **file.txt** as a plain text file
- **file.exe** as executable program/file
- **file.png, file.jpg, file.gif** as image

Another important thing to remember is that Linux is **case sensitive**. It is possible to have more than one file with the same name as long as the characters/letters are different cases [^3]. For example, sample.txt differs from Sample.txt or SAMPLE.txt; although the same filename, these three files can exist because they all differ in the casing.

**Spaces** in the directory and file are ok. However, using space in filenames or directory names is not advised because spaces are used to separate items in the command line. If the filename includes spaces, one must use quotes or escape characters to access it, such as[^3]:

- *cd 'Sample Text'* 
- *cd Sample\Text*

Below will not work:
cd Holiday Photos

The **hidden files and directories** are usually stored with a name starting at **"."** (full stop). Such configuration files are hidden to not "get in the way of the user doing their everyday tasks[^3]".


### Manual Pages[^4]

The **manual pages** are a "set of pages that explain every command available on your system including what they do", which includes the command line arguments that they accept and how to run them, as stated in a set of pages that explain every command available on your system including what they do, as stated in [Ryans Tutorials: Manual Pages!](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/manual.php).

To **invoke the manual pages**, the command is as follows:

```
man <command to look up>
```

Below is the image from [Ryans Tutorials: Manual Pages!](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/manual.php) invoking the manual command (line 1) and its results:

<img width="569" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113204667/208088970-c27afbdd-bb3d-418f-9b4f-6d3379aa4de9.png">

To do a **keyword search** on manual pages:

```
man -k <search term>
```

To **search within a page**:

```
'/' + <the term you want to look up>, + enter

press 'n' to cycle through the result if they appear multiple times

```

To **exit man pages**:

```
'q' to quite
```

#### ls -a, ls --all, ls -alh

To list all directories, including the hidden files, we can use the shorthand (-) -> **ls-a** or the long hand (--) -> **ls --all**, both does the same thing.

**Image 1*
<img width="864" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113204667/208094747-f53dbead-a545-410f-aeb8-94b4af8a8dff.png">

Using a shorthand version (-) invoke many options by placing all the letters after the single dash, such as in the example below (**ls -alh**):

**Image 2**
<img width="864" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113204667/208095818-fb29d58a-ad03-4ee0-a30f-732b96e9e697.png">

By adding multiple options (l and h) after the command ls -a, image 2 contains more information compared to image 1.

### File Manipulation[^5]

#### Creating directory

The command **mkdir (Make Directory)** is used to create a directory, the syntax is as follows:

```
mkdir [options]<Directory>

```

Example:

<img width="865" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113204667/208099384-e11b6c08-031a-499a-803f-68ef43366bd4.png">


An important takeaway is, supplying a directory is the same as supplying a path. More examples of "how we can supply a directory to be created[^5]":

- mkdir ~/linuxSamples/dir2
- mkdir ../dir1
- mkdir ./tadaa
- mkdir /home/issa/bloom

#### Options available for mkdir

- **-p** "tells mkdir to make parent directories as needed[^5]"
- **-v** tells us what mkdir is doing

This image is an example of **-p** from [Ryans Tutorials: File Manipulation!](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/filemanipulation.php):

<img width="539" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113204667/208133944-1c5d03f6-2982-4e2c-942f-5695acb16704.png">

This second image is an example of **-v** from [Ryans Tutorials: File Manipulation!](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/filemanipulation.php):

<img width="545" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113204667/208134086-bc74278b-d334-4560-836b-33e55b27f558.png">


#### Removing directory

The command **rmdir** is used to remove a directory; however, "there is no undo when it comes to the command line on Linux[^5]". The syntax is as follows:

```
rmdir [options]<Directory>

```


#### Creating Blank File

The command **touch** is used to create blank files; it can also be used to modify the modification times and access on the file, which can be detected[^5].

Below is an image example of touch from [Ryans Tutorials: File Manipulation!](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/filemanipulation.php):

<img width="545" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113204667/208138285-d134e658-d159-4527-85df-8d307adfb323.png">


#### Copying File/Directory

The command **cp (stands for copy)** is used to copy or make file/directory duplicate; the syntax is as follows[^5]:

```
cp [options]<destination>

Example:
cp python-fun more-python

```

Using relative and absolute paths on *cp*:

- cp /home/issa/python-fun/py1 py2
- cp sample1 ../projects/sample2


#### Moving a File/Directory

The syntax for moving a file/directory is:

```
mv [options] <source> <destination>

```

The command **mv (stands for move)** is used to move directories without providing the **-r** option[^5].

#### Removing File, Empty and Non-empty Directories

The command **rm (stands for remove)**, is used to delete a file; *rm* also has options that can be used, one of them is option **-r (stands for recursive)**, which allows non-empty directories to be removed or deleted[^5].


### Cheat Sheet[^6]
