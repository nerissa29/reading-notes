## Reading Notes 2: The Bash Command Line

### The Command Line

According to [^1]: [Ryans Tutorials: The Command Line!](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php), a terminal/command line is a "text based interface to the system". It allows to enter commands by typing, and will give results back as text. It starts with a prompt, since I'm using Ubuntu, the prompt as I open it looks like this:

**issa29@DESKTOP-N7B8RN9:~$**

Based on the image below, as stated in [Ryans Tutorials: The Command Line!](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php):

Line1 = the prompt **issa29@DESKTOP-N7B8RN9:~$**, followed by the command **ls**, and the command line **-l /home/issa29**, these three are separated by spaces. the command *ls* is used to list files, while *-l* is an *option* "used to modify the behaviour of the command[^1]".


Lines 2-5 = the output or the results after executing the command.
