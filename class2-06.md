# Reading Notes 06

## An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

### What is node.js?

According to the article Node JS: About Node.js, it is a "JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaS script engine" [^1].

### In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

Based on my understanding, after reading the article from [Hibbar (2020)](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/), Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine is an engine that runs or executes JavaScript code. The V8 engine is the "open source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi [^2]". 

### What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

It means that it built or compiles the JavaScript to machine code that the Operating system (or your computer) can understand [^2].

### What is npm?

NPM is a package manager that comes with Node;

### What version of a node are you running on your machine?

My node version is v18.9.0.

### What version of npm are you running on your machine?

My npm version is 8.19.1

### What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

According to [JavaScript: What Is Node and When Should I Use It?], to install the *jshint*, simply type *npm install -g jshint* on your terminal. The *jshint* can also be used to lint an index.js, for example, by typing *jshint index.js*; it is a tool that looks for JavaScript code errors and problems [3].


### What is a node used for?

It allows the users/developers to write code in JavaScript, which is run by the computer/OS, instead of using or running it in a browser. There is also no need to worry about compatibility issues since it runs directly from the computer instead of the browser [^2].

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

### What are the six reasons for pair programming?

Grampa (2018), in her article *6 Reasons for Pair Programming*, states the six reasons why pair programming is necessary [^4]:

- Greater efficiency
- Engaged collaboration
- Learning from fellow students
- Social skills
- Job interview readiness
- Work environment readiness

### In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

It improves social skills, and one can learn from the other. Developers can differ in coding style and personality; it pushes them to practice communicating with each other and find the right words or technical terms that both will understand. One who is more experienced on the topic can also help those less familiar with it.

### How does pair programming work?

Pair programming is where two developers work together; one is the driver, and the other is the navigator. The driver is the one who writes the code, while the navigator navigates and reviews the code as the driver types in. The two can switch roles here and there.
