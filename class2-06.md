### What is node.js?

According to the aticle Node JS: About Node.js, it is a "JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaS ript engine" [^1].

### In your own words, what is Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript Engine?
Based on my understanding, after reading the article from [Hibbar (2020)](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/), the Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine is an engine that runs or executes JavaScript code. The V8 engine is the "open source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi [^2]". 

### What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

It means that it built or compiles the JavaScript to machine code that the Operating system (or your computer) can understand.
