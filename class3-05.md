## Reading Notes

### Engineering Readings

#### What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

My experience in life has taught me to be strong mentally and emotionally. I can handle a difficult situation, whatever life may give me. My passion and curiosity to learn will help me thrive more.

#### What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on a tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

- It's sometimes hard to stop when I start coding, and sometimes, I am frustrated. I will enforce and try to remember to step away from the computer. I also notice that I often miss and need breaks to see simple mistakes or logic. 
-  I often tried to solve the problem before asking for help. If it is git problem, I do not hesitate. However, when it comes to problem-solving, I try my best to solve it even when I'm stuck for an hour or more before seeking help. I need to break the habit and remember the 15-minute rule.
-  It's easy for me to get lost; I will try my best to break down the problem into simple ones, it will be easier to solve it that way
