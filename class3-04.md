### Data Structures and Algorithms

#### What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

It is important to consider the operations or tasks we will perform, such as adding, retrieving, modifying, or deleting items. It is also critical to know how often these tasks will be executed. Analyzing the problem can help you determine what data structure best meets these requirements and what supports this operation (Mallawaarachchi, 2020).

#### How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

Establishing a *base case* is important to stop the recursive calls. Base Case tells the system or the function when to stop. Once the function stops calling, there won't be an infinite loop.
