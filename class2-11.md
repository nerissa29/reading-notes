### Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

***SQL***

- known as RElational Database (RDBMS)
- is a table-based database; it represent data in form of tables
- has pre-defined schema
- uses *structured query language or SQL* for manipulating or defining the data
- are vertically scalable, increases the horse-power of the hardware


***NoSQL***

- known as non-relational database
- are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases (or wide-column stores)
- has dynamic scheema 
- queries known as *unstructured query language or UnQL*, which focuses on document collection
- are horizontally , " scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load [^1]"



### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

According to the article [SQL vs NoSQL Database Differences Explained with few Example DB](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool), the SQL databases are good for complex queries; it is suited for storing structured data.

### Give a real world example.

Examples of data that can be stored and process using SQL are:

- zip codes
- city
- state
- dates
- ID numbers
- credit card numbers

Most relational databases support permission access, which means it defines who can read data and who is allowed to make changes on the data.
