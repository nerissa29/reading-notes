### Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites

#### Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

The developer uses local storage to help store the state of the user's interface; so, when they close an application, it won't reset, but it will re-open the most recent state stored.The dveelopers "would keep a key on the user’s computer and read it out when the user returns[^1]". Cookie can make this happen; it is a "text file hosted on the user’s computer and connected to the domain that your website runs on[^1]".

#### What information should not be stored in local storage?

The PII (Personally Identifiable Authentication), user's data session, and authorization tokens are one of the critical information that shouldn't be stored in local storage. This is something that shouldn't be shared publicly. Information that is safe for public can be stored in local storage.

#### Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?
