## Reading Notes: Intro to Big O Notation

The Big O Notation, according to Joshi (2017), is a "way of evaluating the performance of an algorithm". It's a way to express how much time a function, algorithm, or other actions, which based on the number of elements required to pass into that function, needs to run. Having a function that multiplies ten numbers is different from a function that handles multiplication of thousands or millions of numbers. This is where the Big O Notation comes in, it takes into the account both the speed and efficiency (Joshi, 2017).
